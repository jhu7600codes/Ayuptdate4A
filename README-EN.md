# AyuGram

AyuGram is an unofficial Telegram client for Android combining features from [AyuGram](https://github.com/AyuGram) and [Nagram](https://github.com/NextAlone/Nagram), with built-in WebProxy protocol support and enhanced privacy features.

- **GitHub Repository**: <https://github.com/jhu7600codes/Ayuptdate4A>
- **Releases**: <https://github.com/jhu7600codes/Ayuptdate4A/releases>

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security Features

1. **Absolute Zero Telemetry**: Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics, and all other background analytics SDKs have been completely eradicated from the source code. Your data stays on your device.
2. **Per-Account Ghost Mode**: Advanced Ghost Mode (Hide Read Status, Hide Typing Status) can now be configured individually for each logged-in account, rather than a global switch.
3. **Secure Automated CI/CD**: The compilation pipeline uses GitHub Actions with in-memory keystore reconstruction, ensuring release signatures are never exposed in the repository.
4. **Independent Identity**: Full surface rebranding and independent configuration paths ensure AyuGram runs in complete isolation from official Telegram or other forks.

## 🛠️ Compilation Guide

**NOTE: For Windows users, please consider using a Linux VM (such as WSL2) or dual booting.**

### Environment

- Linux distribution based on Debian or Arch Linux, or macOS
- Native tools: `gcc` `go` `make` `cmake` `ninja` `yasm`
- Android SDK: `build-tools;35.0.0` `platforms;android-35` `ndk;27.2.12479018` `cmake;3.18.1` `cmake;3.22.1`

### Build Steps

1. Checkout submodules:
   ```shell
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Build native dependencies:
   ```shell
   ./run init libs
   ```
3. Build external libraries and native code:
   ```shell
   ./run libs native
   ```
4. Configure `local.properties`:
   Fill out `TELEGRAM_APP_ID` and `TELEGRAM_APP_HASH` (from [Telegram Developer](https://my.telegram.org/auth)), along with your `KEYSTORE_PASS`, `ALIAS_NAME`, and `ALIAS_PASS`.

5. Build with Gradle:
   ```shell
   ./gradlew TMessagesProj:assemblePublicRelease
   ```

## ☁️ Compilation with GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

AyuGram is configured for secure cloud builds using GitHub Actions. To set this up in your fork:

1. **Generate a Keystore**:
   Create a release keystore, but **do not** commit it to the repository.

2. **Encode Secrets**:
   Encode your keystore and `local.properties` to base64:
   ```bash
   base64 -w 0 TMessagesProj/release.keystore
   base64 -w 0 local.properties
   ```

3. **Add Repository Secrets**:
   Go to your GitHub Repository Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions, and add:
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64`: The output of the keystore base64 command (without the trailing `%`).
   - `LOCAL_PROPERTIES`: The output of the properties base64 command.
   - *(Optional)* `HELPER_BOT_TOKEN` & `HELPER_BOT_TARGET`: For automated Telegram delivery of the compiled APK.

4. **Push to Main**:
   Any push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a clean, signed production build.
